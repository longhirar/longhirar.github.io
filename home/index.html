        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <hr>
        <p>I am a brazillian 14 year old boy that learned coding by himself because he had nothing to do. Currently I have a few coding skills that I have developed during the years:</p>
        <p><b>Java</b> - I have coded Java since 2017, I made everything from Minecraft Mods to a Fast Multithreaded Database Server.</p>
        <p><b>HTML/CSS/JS</b> - I have coded HTML, CSS and Javascript since 2015, and I have gotten pretty good at it. I have made from a responsive website (like this one) to a website containing pretty much every information you might want to know about Pok√©mon.  </p>
        <p><b>Python/NodeJS/Deno/HTTP/TCP</b> - I have been tinkering with Python & NodeJS since 2019, I haven't done big projects yet, but I have been experimenting with servers and protocols, and generally understanding how the internet works.</p>
